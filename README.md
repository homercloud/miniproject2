Manage users with CRUD functions

1 - Import the file "usuarios.csv" into your MySQL database.
2 - Correct the script "conexaobd.php" by putting your connection credentials.

No CSS;
No JavaScript;
Just plain PHP with CRUD database functions;
The first user to register will be considered the master user;
Only the master user can add, edit other user's credentials, and delete other users;
The basic user can only edit their own credentials;
